# Virast - Social Timeline Project

This project is a scalable social network with a **Timeline** feature, built with **Go**, **GORM**, **Redis**, and **MySQL**.  
The goal is to efficiently manage millions of users and posts using a **Fan-out Worker**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **Post Service**: Create new posts by users and add them to the Fanout queue.  
- **Timeline Service**: Fetch user timelines from Redis with Pagination support (`start` / `limit`).  
- **Fan-out Worker**: Distribute posts to followersâ€™ timelines in batches and store records in the `timeline` table.  
- **Repository Pattern / Hexagonal Architecture** for testability and scalability.  
- **Redis ZSET** for fast timeline retrieval ordered by post timestamp.  
- **MySQL** using GORM for data storage.
